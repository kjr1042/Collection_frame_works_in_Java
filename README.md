Welcome to the comprehensive guide to the Java Collection Framework.
## Overview

The Java Collection Framework provides a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections of objects. Whether you're working with lists, sets, maps, or queues, this repository covers it all. 

## Features

- **List Interface:** Explore ordered collections like ArrayList and LinkedList, understanding their differences and best use cases.

- **Set Interface:** Delve into unique collections such as HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet, learning how they handle duplicate elements and maintain order.

- **Map Interface:** Understand key-value pair collections like HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap, and master techniques for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

- **Queue Interface:** Learn about queue implementations like PriorityQueue and LinkedList, and grasp their role in managing elements based on the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle.
